The Common Git Command Line Used includes the following:

git clone ----- to clone our repository

our changes are made using the shell navigation commands
cd, pwd, ls, ls -la, touch, echo, less, mkdir, mv, cp, etc.

git add . is used to stage our changes

git commit -m is used to save our changes

while git push is used to upload our changes into our repository in the remote server


That's just a little for now.
